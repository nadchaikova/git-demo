Staring in the mirror
Watching as the walls are closing in
A shadow of a figure
Trying to make the best of the state that I am in
I guess I could do with the friends
I've been pushing away
But I’m destined to suffer until I discover
The reasons I'm afraid

God knows I try
It might not be good enough
But it's all I have to give
This is all I have to give
You might be right sometimes
I never open up
But it’s all I have to give
This is all I have to give

Staring in the mirror
Picturing the face of a younger man
He buries it away
'Cause he's gotta try and cope
In a way he understands
Be there for your brother
And strong for your mother again
'Cause he's too young to get it
And she'll get upset if she knows you feel the pain

God knows I try
It might not be good enough
But it's all I have to give
This is all I have to give
You might be right sometimes
I'm too scared to open up
But it’s all I have to give
This is all I have to give to you

I tell myself there’s nothing left to lose
I don't know why I’m hiding from the truth
I face myself and all I see is you
Is you
Staring in the mirror
Watching as the walls are closing in

But God knows I try (God knows I try)
It might not be good enough (Might not be good enough)
But it's all I have to give
This is all I have to give
You might be right sometimes
I'm too scared to open up
But it's all I have to give
This is all I have to give to you
