Staring in the mirror
Watching as the walls are closing in
A shadow of a figure
Trying to make the best of the state that I am in
I guess I could do with the friends
I've been pushing away
But I’m destined to suffer until I discover
The reasons I'm afraid

God knows I try
It might not be good enough
But it's all I have to give
This is all I have to give
You might be right sometimes
I never open up
But it’s all I have to give
This is all I have to give
